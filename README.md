## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MySQL database set up
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/attoyibi/mydashboard.git
   cd mydashboard
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   If Node.js is not installed, download it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

   After confirming Node.js and npm are installed, run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Configure your MySQL database connection details. Create a `.env` file in the projectâ€™s root directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=root
   DB_NAME=dashboard
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**
   Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system. If not, download it from the [MySQL official website](https://www.mysql.com/).

   To set up the required database and tables, use MySQL Workbench or another preferred MySQL client to execute the SQL commands found in the `server/db` folder. This folder includes SQL scripts for setting up user and item tables:

   - Navigate to the `server/db` folder.
   - Execute the SQL file to create the tables.

   Example SQL Structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );

   CREATE TABLE item (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      description TEXT,
      quantity INT DEFAULT 0,
      price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**
   With dependencies installed and the database set up, start the server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`. Visit this URL in your browser to access the web application.

6. **Access the Application**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Here, you will find the registration and login form. After logging in, you will be redirected to your dashboard where you can manage your items by adding, editing, or deleting them.
